---The zipped file was too big for GitHub, so we put it on google drive, here is the link:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5Ojj9a9vV81MzdJNUtUeFZqczg/view?usp=sharing


Using the google drive is the EASIEST way to get the full app downloaded, this is a public link and anyone should be able to acccess it. However, if you prefer to do
it the long way here are the instructions:


1. Download the folder that is in GitHub named "SleepFit2.0" and extract it locally. 

2. Download the folder that is in Github named "apk_files" and extract it locally and drop the files in the folder from the first step
   in this directory C:\.......\SleepHygiene\app\build\outputs\apk

3. Download the folder that is in Github named "androidsupport_files" and extract it locally and drop the folder in the folder from the first step
   in this directory C:\........\SleepHygiene\app\build\intermediates\exploded-aar

4. Download the folder that is in Github named "res_files" and extract it locally and drop the folder in the folder from the first step
   in this directory C:\........\SleepHygiene\app\build\intermediates






---Make sure when you run the app you are using Nexus 7 2012 API 21. And to login use the credidentals
Username: Santiago
Password: Agudelo

or any of the other group member's name.

---We didn't get to finish full functionality of the app so some of the buttons, for example 
the alarm button, will make it crash.

---Our third party app called "Sense" is not able to be downloaded 
onto the virtual emulator. Hence, when you try and run the app and 
click the button to the launch the third party app, it will crash.

---We don't have the "Sense" app downloaded on any of the Nexus tablets because the sense
app was only compatible with the samsung tablets.We used a samsung tablet provided by one 
of the group members to troubleshoot and for the presentation.
